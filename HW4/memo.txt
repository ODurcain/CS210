For the bad1 it output that there was a mismatch of open/close delimiters. For bad2 it showed that the initial delimiter was never closed. For the good test case it showed there were no errors.

Yes! my program did exactly as expected.

One thing that happened is the comparison for checking the mismatch was done, but I placed it after the else if statement that defines c2 rather than inside of it, so this ended up making the program never properly catch the mismatch. Once I figured that out everything worked as expected.
