My strategy initially started with the end cases of any, or no value being a possible root which was fairly straightforward. Initially I didn't realize that I can also nest in all a=0 possibilities through else statements inside of my nested if loop. Once I did realize this it actually simplified my whole code quite a bit. Beyond that, all other scenarios were derived from the discriminant being eqaul to, or greater/less than 0. I had initially considered a differnt structure for defining a=0 possibilities, but it was being very finicky and not properly transitioning into a linear equation to find the only possible root. As stated above I went with the if/else loop logic you currently see in my code. I deleted all my original code and held it in a notes file for use if it became relevant later, but my current code structure is much cleaner.
